The easiest solution to copy unselectable text on iOS is to take advantage of the *[Live Text](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT212630)* feature launched upon iOS 15.

If you own an iPhone XS, iPhone XR, or later models with iOS 15 or later, navigate to "Settings" > "General" > "Language & Region" > "Live Text", and turn it on. Then go to Photos, and you will find the text on your photos become selectable and copy-pastable.

So next time you want to copy unselectable text on your screen, it's as simple as taking a screenshot and dealing with it on the Photos app.
