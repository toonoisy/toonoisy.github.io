Yesterday afternoon, I was about to update my phone when the screen prompted me to enter a passcode, and that's when I suddenly forgot the pin I used everyday for a year long.

After being anxious and annoyed alongside a few more failed attempts within the next few hours, I knew I had to restore my iPhone thanked to apple's stringent security protection policy.

The real sad story afterwards was, I lost all my previous photos because I had turned its backup off for god knows what reason. We lost our dog not long ago, now I've lost most of his pics too, alongside those big moments and trivial moments from my life over the past several years.

I felt angry and betrayed by my own mind.

Get your shit organized and your passwords written down, buddy. Your brain is not as reliable as you think it is, and backups are more important than you believe.
